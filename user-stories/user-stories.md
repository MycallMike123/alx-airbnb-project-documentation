# Airbnb Clone Backend – User Stories

These user stories are based on the use case interactions illustrated in the system diagram. They represent core functionalities that the Airbnb Clone backend must support.

## User Stories

1. **As a user, I want to register and log into my account**  
   so that I can access Airbnb’s services either as a guest or host.

2. **As a host, I want to list my property**  
   so that guests can view and book it.

3. **As a guest, I want to search for available properties by location and price**  
   so that I can find a place to stay that meets my budget and needs.

4. **As a guest, I want to book a property for specific dates**  
   so that I can reserve accommodation for my trip.

5. **As a user, I want to receive notifications about bookings and payments**  
   so that I can stay informed about my activity on the platform.
